It defines the structure of a webpage.

Each `panel` represents an expanding card with a background image fetched from Unsplash and a title (`<h3>`). One panel is initially given the class `active`.\n\n*   **script.js:** This JavaScript file provides the interactivity for the expanding cards. It:\n    *   Selects all elements with the class `panel` using `document.querySelectorAll('.panel')`.\n    *   Attaches a click event listener to each panel.\n    *   When a panel is clicked:\n        *   It calls the `removeActiveClasses()` function to remove the `active` class from all panels.\n        *   It adds the `active` class to the clicked panel.\n    *   The `removeActiveClasses()` function iterates through all panels and removes the `active` class from each.\n\n*   **style.css:** This CSS file defines the styling for the webpage. It includes:\n    *   A Google Font import (`Muli`).\n    *   Basic styling for the `body` to center the content.\n    *   Styling for the `.container` to arrange the panels horizontally.\n    *   Styling for the `.panel` elements, including background images, size, transitions, and hiding the `h3` element initially.\n    *   Styling for the `.panel.active` state to make the selected panel expand and show the `h3` element.\n    *   A media query to hide the 4th and 5th panels on smaller screens (mobile devices).\n\n**In summary:** This code implements an \"Expanding Cards\" effect.  Initially, the panels are small, showing only a portion of the background image.  When you click on a panel, it expands to fill more space, pushing the other panels to the side and revealing the title. The Javascript handles the active class assignment and removal, which the CSS styles differently to achieve the desired effect.\n\n*   **hi:** I am unsure of what this file is as I was only provided with the content of the file, not the file extension.

        "text": "The prevailing scientific theory for the beginning of the universe is the **Big Bang theory**. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n*   **Singularity:** The theory states that approximately 13.8 billion years ago, all the matter and energy in the universe were concentrated into an extremely hot, dense singularity – a point of infinite density. Think of it like everything we see today compressed into something far smaller than an atom.\n\n*   **Expansion:** For reasons we don't fully understand, this singularity began to expand rapidly. This wasn't an explosion *in* space, but rather an expansion *of* space itself. As space expanded, the universe cooled.\n\n*   **Formation of Particles:** As the universe cooled, energy converted into fundamental particles like quarks, leptons (including electrons), and bosons. These particles combined to form protons and neutrons.\n\n*   **Formation of Atoms:** Eventually, the universe cooled enough for protons and neutrons to combine to form the nuclei of simple atoms like hydrogen and helium.\n\n*   **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe became transparent.  Photons (light) could now travel freely.  This light is still detectable today as the Cosmic Microwave Background, which provides strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.\n\n*   **Formation of Stars and Galaxies:** Over millions of years, gravity caused the hydrogen and helium to clump together, forming stars and eventually galaxies.\n\n*   **Ongoing Expansion:** The universe continues to expand and evolve to this day.  Scientists are still working to understand the details of the Big Bang and the early universe.\n\n**Key evidence supporting the Big Bang theory includes:**\n\n*   **Redshift:** The observation that galaxies are moving away from us, and that the farther away they are, the faster they're receding. This supports the idea of an expanding universe.\n*   **Cosmic Microwave Background:** The CMB is a faint afterglow of the Big Bang, providing a snapshot of the early universe.\n*   **Abundance of Light Elements:** The observed ratio of hydrogen and helium in the universe matches predictions made by the Big Bang theory.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **What caused the Big Bang?**  The Big Bang theory describes what happened *after* the initial expansion began, but it doesn't explain what caused the singularity or why it started expanding. This is a question that is still being actively researched.\n*   **Beyond the Big Bang:** Some theories explore what might have existed *before* the Big Bang, such as the idea of a multiverse or a cyclic universe. However, these theories are more speculative and lack direct observational evidence.\n*   **The theory is constantly being refined:** The Big Bang theory is not a static, unchanging idea. As scientists gather new data and develop new models, the theory is constantly being refined and updated.\n\nIn essence, the Big Bang theory is the most comprehensive and well-supported explanation we have for the origin and evolution of the universe, but it's also a work in progress.\n"
