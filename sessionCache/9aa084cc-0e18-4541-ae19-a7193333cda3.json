This most likely refers to **Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)**.\n\nDynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a technology in Microsoft Windows operating systems that allows applications to share data with each other.  It's an older technology that's largely been superseded by newer methods like COM (Component Object Model) and OLE (Object Linking and Embedding).\n\nHere's a bit more about DDE:\n\n*   **How it Works:**  DDE establishes a connection between applications, allowing one application (the client) to request data from another application (the server).  The server application then provides the data to the client.\n\n*   **Use Cases (Historically):**  DDE was often used for things like:\n    *   Linking a spreadsheet to a word processing document so that changes in the spreadsheet would automatically update the document.\n    *   Real-time data feeds (e.g., a stock ticker updating a spreadsheet).\n\n*   **Security Concerns:**  DDE has known security vulnerabilities and has been a target for malware exploits. This is one of the main reasons it's largely deprecated.\n\n*   **Why it's Less Common Now:**  Modern technologies like COM and OLE offer more robust and secure ways for applications to communicate.  DDE is generally not recommended for new development.\n\nSo, is there something specific you'd like to know about DDE?  For instance:\n\n*   Are you trying to use DDE for something?\n*   Are you encountering an error related to DDE?\n*   Are you curious about the history of DDE?\n\nTell me what you're interested in, and I'll try to give you a more helpful answer.\n"
